Toxicity Classification
1. Business Problem
Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can classify the toxicity of a comment. Given a user comment, the model should predict how toxic the comment is, with toxicity scores ranging from 0 to 1.

Dataset
The dataset is provided by Kaggle through the Jigsaw Unintended Bias in Toxicity Classification competition.

Source: Kaggle Jigsaw Dataset
2. Machine Learning Problem Formulation
2.1 Data
Dataset Description
Train Data: Contains user comments and their associated toxicity scores.
Test Data: Contains user comments for which toxicity predictions need to be made.
Key Columns in Train Data:
comment_text: The text of the comment (string format).
target: Target values (toxicity score) ranging between 0 and 1.
2.2 Objective
Build a model to predict the target value, which indicates the toxicity score of a comment. A value close to 1 means high toxicity, while a value close to 0 means low or no toxicity.

2.3 Performance Metric
The evaluation metric for this competition is Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC). The goal is to maximize the ROC-AUC score.

3. Approach
3.1 Preprocessing
Steps involved in preprocessing the data:

Text Cleaning: Removing unnecessary characters, symbols, and stop words.
Tokenization: Converting the text into tokens.
Vectorization: Transforming text data into numerical form using techniques like TF-IDF or Word Embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe).
Handling Imbalanced Data: Applying techniques like undersampling, oversampling, or class weighting.
3.2 Model Building
Potential models to try:

Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Random Forests
Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM)
Deep Learning Models (LSTM, GRU)
3.3 Model Evaluation
Validation: Use cross-validation to tune hyperparameters and avoid overfitting.
Metrics: Use AUC-ROC to evaluate model performance.
